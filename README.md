# Web Scraper
## General Info
Here we will try to build a generic web scraper. As an example
we will try to scrape laptop product details from Walmart webpage.
Note that this is not to be used for commercial purposes. It is only
for testing and learning purposes.

## Technology
Python  
bash script

## Setup 
Fork this repo, pull it into your local system and run! 

The code will also give out snapshots whenever the scrape is 
successful or when error screenshots when the scrape fails.

## Output
The final output is a .csv file with all the scrapes and their
success status.

## Status
Few more refinements on the way to make this code more generic.
I will have more scraper samples coming in for Amazon.com, etsy.com etc.
