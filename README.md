# Web Scraper
## General Info
Here we will try to build a generic web scraper. As an example
we will try to scrape laptop product details from Walmart webpage.
Note that this is not to be used for commercial purposes. It is only
for testing and learning purposes.

## Technology
Python  
bash script

## Setup 
Fork this repo, pull it into your local system and run! 

## Status
Few more refinements on the way. I will have more scraper samples
coming in for Amazon.com, etsy.com etc.
